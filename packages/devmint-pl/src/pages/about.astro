      I&apos;m Greg, a self-taught software developer with a love for building clean code and breaking speed limits—both in
      projects and on the road. From fine-tuning backend systems to binge-reading manga and cheering during F1 weekends, I live at
      the intersection of logic and passion. This blog is my digital garage for experiments, notes, and ideas worth sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started out building simple websites with Drupal and WordPress—tweaking themes, wrangling plugins, and learning the hard
      way that “just one more module” rarely solves the problem. From there, I stepped into the world of object-oriented PHP,
      where I got serious about architecture, patterns, and writing code that didn’t collapse under its own weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, curiosity (and frustration) led me to the Node.js ecosystem. I re-learned how to think about the backend,
      embraced JavaScript fully, and—after years of PHP templates and jQuery hacks—taught myself how to build modern frontends
      from scratch. That’s when I met React, and everything changed. Fast forward a few years and one Go talk at a tech conference
      later, I fell in love with the simplicity and raw speed of Golang. Today, I work as a full-stack developer fluent in Node,
      Go, and React—with just enough DevOps to ship things without breaking production (most of the time).
