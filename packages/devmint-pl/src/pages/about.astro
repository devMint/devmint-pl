          I&apos;m Greg, a self-taught software developer with a love for building clean code and breaking speed limits—both in
          projects and on the road. From fine-tuning backend systems to binge-reading manga and cheering during F1 weekends, I
          live at the intersection of logic and passion. This blog is my digital garage for experiments, notes, and ideas worth
          sharing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started out building simple websites with Drupal and WordPress—tweaking themes, wrangling plugins, and learning the
          hard way that “just one more module” rarely solves the problem. From there, I stepped into the world of object-oriented
          PHP, where I got serious about architecture, patterns, and writing code that didn’t collapse under its own weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, curiosity (and frustration) led me to the Node.js ecosystem. I re-learned how to think about the backend,
          embraced JavaScript fully, and—after years of PHP templates and jQuery hacks—taught myself how to build modern frontends
          from scratch. That’s when I met React, and everything changed. Fast forward a few years and one Go talk at a tech
          conference later, I fell in love with the simplicity and raw speed of Golang. Today, I work as a full-stack developer
          fluent in Node, Go, and React—with just enough DevOps to ship things without breaking production (most of the time).
